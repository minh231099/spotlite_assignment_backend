# Please Read This

This is a very interesting module as I can learn a lot through this assignment. This is the first time I've done an infinite scroll, and the time is quite short for both the back-end and the front-end (about a little more than a day), so the front-end will still have some bugs (Flickering screen when fetching new data, resize). But I tried to perfect the basics. So I hope you will sympathize with me.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) with your browser to see the result.
